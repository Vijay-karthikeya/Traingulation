# Triangulation-Algorithms in Computational geometry
A C++ OpenGL application that demonstrates **Ear Clipping Triangulation** to solve the **Art Gallery Problem**.
This tool takes a simple polygon as input, decomposes it into triangles using the Ear Clipping algorithm, and visualizes the triangulation process in real-time using GLFW and OpenGL.

Problem statement:
How many guards are sufficient to observe every point inside an art gallery, modeled as a simple polygon?
Triangulation answers this by decomposing the polygon into triangles, which makes visibility analysis and guard placement easier.

Input is a set 2-D coordinates, with the total number of polygons given in the start in data.txt.

Make sure to upload the coordinates in CCW.
